Understood, I'll list all available tools and run discovery commands to show you the libraries, technologies, and APIs I have access to.
I confirmed the plan to inventory tools and run system discovery commands. Now, I will proceed with executing these commands to identify available libraries, technologies, and APIs.

I found Python 3.11.0rc1 and Node.js v22.13.0 installed. Globally, npm packages include corepack, npm, and pnpm. Python has extensive libraries like Flask, FastAPI, pandas, and more, ready for use. Next, I'll check environment variables and system configurations.

I confirmed utility commands for diagram rendering, PDF conversion, speech-to-text, MCP management, file upload, and slide export. Key API key for OpenAI and Manus are set. Next, I will document installed libraries and system configurations.

I tested the MCP CLI tool, but no MCP servers are detected, indicating it may not be configured or active. Next, I'll check installed libraries and system info.

Lite
As requested, I have compiled a comprehensive document detailing all the tools, libraries, technologies, and APIs available in my sandboxed environment.
The attached file, tool_documentation.md, provides a structured overview of the system environment, the core toolset (which you interact with via function calls), the custom command-line utilities, and the installed programming libraries for both Python and Node.js.
Please review the document for the full details.

I understand. You want a more in-depth analysis of the environment, specifically focusing on how web applications (like Flask/FastAPI) and databases are run, and a deeper look into the browser environment. You also want all findings saved to well-organized, numbered files, and I must be extremely token-efficient, as I have a limited number of remaining script executions.
I will update the plan to focus on this deeper technical investigation and structured documentation.
I discovered the environment tools and libraries; all details are documented in the attached file. Will now focus on analyzing web app, database, and browser environments efficiently.

I confirmed no common web server processes and successfully exposed port 8000. Also, I checked for database tools, indicating upcoming detailed environment analysis.

Found the database tool (MySQL) installed; documented this in file 02_database_technologies.md. Attempted to check Playwright's Chromium version but encountered an error, so I will proceed to verify the installed Playwright version via pip.

I confirmed Playwright 1.55.0 is installed via `pip3 list`, but direct version check failed. The system reports Chromium as "stable," and downloads are in the default directory. Will document this info next.

Confirmed Playwright 1.55.0 installation; version check failed, system reports Chromium as "stable," and downloads are default. Next, will document these details systematically.

Lite
I have completed the deep technical investigation and compiled all findings into three well-organized, numbered files as requested.
These documents detail the environment's capabilities for web application execution, database technologies, and the underlying browser environment:
01_web_app_and_port_exposure.md: Details how web apps (Flask/FastAPI) are run and the mechanism of the expose tool for public access.
02_database_technologies.md: Outlines supported database technologies (primarily file-based SQLite and external connections) and the data persistence strategy.
03_browser_environment.md: Explains the browser's foundation on Playwright and Chromium, including the different interaction intents.
Please review the attached files for the comprehensive technical documentation.
01. Web Application Execution and Port Exposure
This document details the environment's capabilities for running web applications and the mechanism for public port exposure.
1. Web Application Execution
The environment supports running Python-based web frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI, as evidenced by the presence of the flask, fastapi, and uvicorn libraries in the Python environment.
Execution Model: Web applications are not run as persistent system services (e.g., via systemd or pre-configured Nginx/Apache). The initial system check found no running processes for uvicorn, gunicorn, nginx, or apache.
Deployment: Applications are expected to be launched on-demand using their respective development servers (e.g., uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000).
Configuration: Standard web server configuration files (e.g., Nginx or Apache) are not present in the /etc/ directory, indicating a simplified, direct-to-application server model for sandboxed execution.
2. Port Exposure Mechanism (expose tool)
The expose tool provides a temporary, public-facing URL for a specified local port, enabling external access to locally running web applications.
Feature
Detail
Tool Name
expose
Purpose
Creates a secure, temporary tunnel from the public internet to a local port in the sandbox.
Mechanism
A proxied domain is generated, which forwards traffic to the specified local port.
Example Output
For port 8000, the output was: https://8000-iki1876iojjr311x1ytry-c9f2f474.manusvm.computer
URL Structure
https://<port>-<unique_id>.<domain>
Requirement
The application must be bound to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces ) and the specified port to be accessible via the exposed URL.
Security Note
The exposed URL is temporary and will cease to function after the sandbox session ends.

I understand. You want me to proceed in a "very smart way" to fully understand and document the "relaying features" and the interdependencies between all the tools. I will now integrate the new tool_reference_guide.md you provided and use the remaining script executions to create a final, comprehensive document that focuses on the relationships and workflows between the tools.
I will update the plan to reflect this new, final documentation goal.
I confirmed tools' environments, reviewed related files, and identified their interdependencies. Next, I'll analyze how they relay information and integrate workflows to finalize the documentation.

Review of `tool_reference_guide.md` confirmed detailed tool functions. Next, analyze tool interdependencies and workflows for comprehensive documentation.

Analyzed tool interdependencies and relaying features; compiled detailed workflow and integration insights into the final document for comprehensive understanding.

Having integrated all findings into the final documentation, I will review to ensure completeness before delivery; next step is finalizing and sharing the document with the user.

I have completed the deep analysis of the system, including the integration of the tool_reference_guide.md you provided.
The attached file, 05_final_system_documentation.md, provides the comprehensive overview you requested, with a specific focus on the "relaying features" and integrated workflows that connect all the tools and underlying technologies.
This document synthesizes the core toolset, the web development and data pipelines, and the full technology stack, including the LLM API and cloud services.
