Understood. I will continue creating the remaining slides systematically, completing all demonstrations and generating comprehensive logs for analysis. I'll proceed with the remaining slides while maintaining the technical blueprint aesthetic.
When the task involves initial exploration, testing, or familiarization with a new set of tools, scripts, or an unknown system environment.
When the task involves initial exploration, testing, or familiarization with a new set of tools, scripts, or an unknown system environment, the agent must work on autopilot, planning and running all tools systematically and exhaustively. This process should continue until no additional logs, information, or clues about the technologies behind each tool can be obtained. The goal is to maximize information gathering and understanding of the environment.

Created detailed slides on external info integration and network exposure tools, focusing on technical architecture, specifications, and consistent blueprint style for next demonstrations.
Batch generating slides 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
not slides. u msut test all tools dont do only slides.  run all commands u can run to udnerstadn exaclty the libraries used , run in terminal all inn a w aya the the logs will tell u the msot info msot useful

Understood completely. I will stop creating slides and instead focus on systematically executing all tools and commands in the terminal to extract detailed logs and information about the underlying libraries and technologies. I will run comprehensive tests to understand exactly what each tool uses.
I confirmed the focus shift to executing terminal commands and testing tools to gather detailed logs on libraries, dependencies, and underlying technologies, replacing slide creation.
Analyzed the Python environment; confirmed installed libraries and their versions, and examined module paths to understand underlying dependencies for the project. Next, will review the project structure.
I confirmed the Python environment, including paths and site packages. Next, I will review the project structure generated by the WebDev init process.
I verified the Node.js version (v22.13.0), package managers, and global packages. The project uses dependencies like React, TailwindCSS, and Vite. The build configuration and plugins indicate a modern, React-based setup. Next, I'll examine the project structure.
The project uses TypeScript with "ESNext" modules, React 18, TailwindCSS, Vite, and Radix UI. Modules are organized in "client/src," "shared," and "server." Next, I will examine dependencies in package.json.
Tested diagram rendering utilities; manus-render-diagram is a statically linked ELF executable processing Mermaid files to PNG images. Next, I will review project structure to identify dependencies and technologies.
do it in the msot effective possible way as you almost have no tokens. save all logs to files

Understood. I will execute all remaining inspections efficiently and save all logs directly to files to preserve token usage.
When performing exhaustive tool and script exploration, especially when token budget is a concern.

When performing exhaustive tool and script exploration, the process must be executed in the most token-effective way possible. All generated logs must be saved to files to conserve tokens and ensure a complete record of the exploration is maintained.

I analyzed the project structure, dependencies, and tools; collected system, environment, and library info; and will review logs to identify underlying technologies used.
I discovered Python 3.11.0rc1 and Node.js installed, with global npm packages. The web project folder exists; next, will analyze logs for detailed structure.
